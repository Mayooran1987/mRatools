## Overview

The ‘mRatools’ package aims to develop to make it easy to install and
load multiple microbiological risk assessment based R packages in a
single step. Also, a description of this package’s functions is
available at
<https://mayooran1987.github.io/mRatools/reference/index.html>.

The package name ‘mRatools’ is created from Microbiological Risk
Assessment Tools, which currently includes four R packages. In future,
more R packages will be comprised, associated with microbiological risk
assessment-based research. Therefore, any R user can install all four
packages in a single step via installing the ‘mRatools’ package.

The following Packages are comprised in the ‘mRatools’ package:

1.  [grabsampling](https://mayooran1987.github.io/grabsampling/) - The
    goal of grabsampling is to the probability of detection calculation
    for grab samples selection by using two different methods such as
    systematic or random based on two-state Markov chain in bulk
    production process.

2.  [mixingsimulation](https://mayooran1987.github.io/mixingsimulation/) -
    The goal of mixingsimulation is to develop simulated results and
    comparing graphical displays for different mixing plans.

3.  [uneqmixr](https://mayooran1987.github.io/uneqmixr/index.html) - The
    ‘uneqmix’ package aims to develop for estimate probabilities
    associated with risk assessment when aggregating unequal incremental
    samples. Also, the package provides graphical displays for different
    various sampling schemes.

4.  [dilutionrisk](https://mayooran1987.github.io/dilutionrisk/) - The
    ‘dilutionrisk’ package aims to develop for getting probability
    estimations and graphical displays in the study associated with
    modelling and assessment of risk based on aerobic plate count (APC)
    on diluted testing.
